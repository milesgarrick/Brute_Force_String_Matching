//This program takes in "text" input and a "pattern" as command line arguments.
//Both arguments are treated as strings.  A brute-force algorithm for matching
//the pattern to the text is executed.  The program prints a visualization of
//the text compared to the pattern on each iteration of the algorithm, then
//returns the index of the first element in the substring of the text that
//matches the pattern.

    //stringMatch iterates through the text, comparing each element to the
    //pattern.  When a character in the text does not match the coinciding
    //character in the pattern, the starting index of comparison increments.
    //If the starting index of comparison is greater than the difference of
    //the length of the text and the length of the pattern, the algorithm
    //returns unsuccessful.  If the entirety of the pattern matches a
    //substring of the text, the program reports a success and returns the
    //starting index of the matching substring in the text.
